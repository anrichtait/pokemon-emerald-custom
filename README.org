* Pokemon Emerald Expansion Onuz Base

** Project Overview
As a lifelong Pokémon enthusiast, I've enjoyed playing these games since childhood, and my interest has persisted into adulthood. Over time, I found myself drawn to nuzlocke challenges and exploring custom ROMs like Storm Silver by Drayano, which offer heightened difficulty and fresh gameplay experiences.

Discovering the world of decomp projects opened up a new avenue for me to merge my interests in Pokémon with programming. As a father, this project also presents a unique opportunity to create a customized game specifically tailored for my kids. While they are still young, creating a full-fledged difficulty hack isn't feasible, but I aim to strike a balance that makes the game enjoyable for them while still providing a challenge that I can nuzlocke in my limited free time.

** Features

*** Custom Gyms

In this Pokémon Emerald decomp project, each gym will offer a unique challenge tailored to highlight the strengths of their respective types. Gone are the days of facing repetitive teams of Geodudes with Tackle; instead, every trainer in the gym will have their own custom party with improved AI and strategic decision-making. The gym leader will serve as the ultimate challenge, requiring careful planning and problem-solving to overcome.

To balance the increased difficulty, each gym leader will reward players with an extra item specific to their gym type upon defeat. For instance, after defeating Brawly at the Dewford Gym, players will receive a Black Belt.

**** Rustboro City: Rock Gym
  - [X] Custom parties for all trainers.
  - [X] Custom party for Roxanne.
  - [X] New reward item (Hard Stone).
  - [X] Custom gym sign stating strengths and weaknesses of Rock type.
  - [ ] Introduce Red with a custom team and narrative explanation.
